** 1. Context **

FairWorkly is a multi-module SaaS platform consisting of several distinct business domains:

- Auth (authentication & user identity)
- Compliance (award rule engine, roster checks, Q&A)
- Documents (company documents & storage)
- Payroll (summary, pay-run insights)
- Employee (HR employee directory)

The product is expected to grow into an enterprise-grade application with:

- Multiple engineering contributors
- Continuous feature expansion
- Reusable UI components
- A clean mapping between business domains and code structure
- Long-term maintainability and onboarding friendliness
- API alignment with backend domain boundaries

Given these needs, we require a frontend architecture that:

1. Scales across multiple modules
2. Keeps domain boundaries clear
3. Encourages code reuse without accidental coupling
4. Supports React + TypeScript + React Query conventions
5. Allows independent evolution of modules
6. Keeps UI, business logic, and API contracts separated

This ADR defines the chosen directory layout and modular structure of the FairWorkly frontend.

** 2. Decision **

We will structure the FairWorkly frontend as follows:

src/
├── main.tsx
├── app/ # App shell (providers, routes)
├── store/ # Redux store (cross-module)
├── services/ # API layer (React query)
├── slices/ # Cross-domain global state (auth/ui/notifications)
├── modules/ # Business modules (feature-driven)
│ ├── home/
│ ├── auth/
│ ├── compliance/
│ ├── documents/
│ ├── payroll/
│ └── employee/
├── shared/ # Reusable components/logics/utilities
├── assets/
└── styles/

2.1 Modules represent business domains

Each folder under modules/ maps to a backend bounded context:

modules/compliance ↔ Backend: Domain.Compliance + Application.Compliance
modules/payroll ↔ Backend: Domain.Payroll + Application.Payroll
modules/employee ↔ Backend: Domain.Employees

Each module contains:

modules/<module>/
pages/ # Route-level pages (public UI entry)
features/ # Medium-to-large domain-specific UI units (smart components)
ui/ # Pure presentational components (reusable within module only)
hooks/ # Business logic hooks (module-specific)
types/ # Domain types, DTO shapes, API contract

2.2 Shared folder stores global reusable pieces

shared/components/ui → design system components
shared/hooks → cross-module hooks
shared/utils → formatters, validators, helpers
shared/types → global types (e.g., ApiResponse, Pagination)

Rules:

- Anything used by multiple modules → shared/
- Anything used by only one module → stays inside that module
- UI components follow atomic design levels:

              * shared = product-wide atoms/molecules
              * modules/<domain>/ui = domain-specific UI atoms
              * modules/<domain>/features = composite components with logic

2.3 API layer is separated from modules

All HTTP/API code lives in: services/\*.ts

Each file maps to a backend API domain:

- complianceApi.ts
- payrollApi.ts
- documentsApi.ts
  …

Modules import API functions instead of creating fetch logic inside pages/components.This maintains:

- Single responsibility
- Mocking/testability
- API change isolation

2.4 Redux is used only for global concerns

Only application-wide concerns go into store/ and slices/:

- authentication state
- theme state
- notifications
- global UI flags

Domain-specific state lives inside:

- React Query caches
- Module hooks
- Local component state

This avoids Redux bloat and improves performance.

2.5 Routing is centralized

All routes are declared in: app/routes/
Modules export their own lazy-loaded route lists.

2.6 Strong typing and domain alignment

Each module maintains a types folder to represent:

- DTOs returned by backend module
- Business entities
- Enum values
- API request/response schemas

This guarantees:

- A 1:1 alignment with backend business domain
- Contract clarity
- Easier onboarding
- Faster refactor safety

** 3. Rationale **

We selected this architecture because it provides:

3.1 Scalability

Modules can grow independently without bloating the root src/ folder.

3.2 Clear domain boundaries

Future engineers instantly understand:

- Compliance logic → /modules/compliance
- Payroll logic → /modules/payroll

3.3 High cohesion, low coupling

- UI components stay near where they’re used
- Business logic stays inside hooks
- Types stay inside domain folders
- Shared library is clean and intentional

3.4 Aligns front-end and backend architectures

This mirrors backend layering:

frontend modules ↔ backend bounded contexts
frontend pages ↔ backend API endpoints
frontend types ↔ backend DTOs
frontend hooks ↔ backend application commands/queries

This significantly reduces mental overhead across teams.

3.5 Supports parallel work

Different developers can build different modules without merge conflicts.

3.6 Supports lazy-loading and code splitting

Pages and modules can be dynamically imported.

3.7 Supports design system growth

shared/components/ui can evolve into a design system similar to:

- Shopify Polaris
- MUI Base
- Radix UI

4. Alternatives Considered

A. Flat feature folder without domain modules
Rejected because:

- No domain boundaries
- Impossible to scale beyond ~50 files
- Difficult onboarding
- Hard to manage cross-team development

B. Colocating everything inside feature folders
Rejected because:

- Types/hooks/UI components become fragmented
- Hard to reuse components
- Leads to duplication
- Difficult for API alignment

C. Next.js-style /app route-first
Rejected because FairWorkly requires:

- Cross-module React Query
- RTK integration
- Non-SSR architecture
- Progressive module isolation

5. Consequences

5.1 Positive

- Scales well with new business domains
- Extremely easy for onboarding engineers
- Clear mapping between backend and frontend
- Encourages clean separation of concerns
- Reduces accidental coupling between modules
- Easier to test and mock API layers
- No global Redux clutter
- Enables lazy-loading and optimized bundles

5.2 Negative

- Slightly more directory depth
- Developers need to follow module boundaries strictly
- Over-modularization risk if engineers don’t follow guidelines

6. Decision Outcome

This directory structure becomes the official standard for FairWorkly front-end development.
All new modules and features must follow the domain-first structure defined here.

Future architecture decisions (MFE, design-system extraction, backend-for-frontend) will extend this foundation.
