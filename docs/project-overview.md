Project Overview — How FairWorkly Works

1. What We Are Building

FairWorkly is a B2B SaaS platform that helps Australian SMEs make Payroll and Roster decisions that are compliant, auditable, and explainable.Our core value is not UI polish or automation speed, but trustworthy decisions produced by agents.

FairWorkly is designed for real-world SME scenarios where:

- business owners often handle payroll and Roster themselves,
- compliance rules (Awards) are complex and change frequently,
- decisions must be explainable after the fact.

From an engineering perspective, FairWorkly is a decision system, not a CRUD system.

2. The Problem We Are Solving

Australian HR compliance is difficult because:

- Award rules are complex and non-trivial to interpret correctly.
- Payroll and roster decisions must comply with legal rules.
- Mistakes are expensive and often discovered too late.

Existing tools either:

- automate decisions without explaining why, or
- provide static information without enforcing correctness.

FairWorkly addresses this gap by producing decisions that are both correct and auditable.

3. What Is an Agent in FairWorkly?

Agents are the core building blocks of FairWorkly.

In FairWorkly, an Agent is a system component that:

- receives a user intent,
- applies rules and workflows,
- produces a decision,
- records that decision for audit,
- and can explain the outcome.

An agent is not:

- just a UI feature,
- just a chatbot,
- just an API endpoint.

An agent is a decision-producing system.

**_ Core Agents in the MVP _**

Roster Agent:

- Determines whether rosters and working arrangements comply with Award rules.

Payroll Agent:

- Validates whether already-calculated pay outcomes (e.g., payslips, pay items, hours, rates) comply with the applicable Award rules.FairWorkly does not calculate payroll—payroll calculation is handled by external payroll systems.

FairBot:

- Provides guided interaction and explanations across agents, helping users understand outcomes.

FairWorkly focuses on compliance checking, auditability, and explainability.

4. How the System Works (High-Level)

This is a simplified, non-technical view of how FairWorkly works.

- Example: “Check roster compliance”

1. A user interacts with the frontend and submits a request.
2. The frontend sends the request to the backend.
3. The backend authenticates and authorizes the request.
4. The Roster Agent executes business workflows and rules.
5. The decision and relevant data are persisted for audit.
6. The result and explanation are returned to the frontend.
7. The frontend displays the outcome to the user.

- Example: “Check pay compliance”

1. A user imports or connects pay results generated by an external payroll system.
2. The frontend sends a pay compliance check request to the backend.
3. The backend authenticates and authorizes the request.
4. The Payroll Agent evaluates the pay outcomes against the relevant Award rules.
5. The decision and evidence are persisted for audit.
6. The result and explanation are returned to the frontend for display.

Key idea:
The frontend asks, the backend decides.

5. Frontend vs Backend Responsibilities

FairWorkly has a clear separation of responsibilities.

Frontend responsibilities:

- Collect user input
- Display results and explanations
- Handle UI state (loading, error, empty)
- Provide a clear user experience

Backend responsibilities:

- Apply compliance and payroll rules
- Make authoritative decisions
- Persist audit data
- Enforce correctness and consistency

## Frontend | Backend

User interaction | Decision making
UI & UX | Business rules
Presentation logic | Compliance logic
No final judgement | Single source of truth

Any logic that determines correctness, legality, or compliance must live in the backend.

6. Backend Architecture (At a Glance)

FairWorkly backend uses a four-layer architecture, with CQRS + MediatR introduced in Compliance and Payroll agents.

- API — receives requests, performs authentication, dispatches commands/queries
- Application — orchestrates workflows (CQRS handlers)
- Domain — contains business rules and core logic
- Infrastructure — persistence, external services, technical concerns

This separation exists to:

- protect core business rules,
- keep workflows explicit,
- make decisions auditable and testable.

7. Frontend Architecture (At a Glance)

Frontend is organized by business modules, not by technical layers.

- app/ — application shell (providers, routes)
- modules/ — business modules (compliance, payroll, fairbot, auth, home)
- shared/ — reusable UI and utilities
- services/ — API access layer
- store/ / slices/ — global state (used sparingly)

Frontend does not decide correctness. It requests decisions and renders results.

8. MVP Scope and Focus

For the MVP phase, our primary focus is:

- Roster Agent
- Payroll Agent
- FairBot

9. How to Use This Document

This document is not a technical tutorial.

Its purpose is to:

- align everyone on what FairWorkly is building,
- explain why certain technical constraints exist,
- help contributors understand where their work fits.

If you are unsure where something belongs, do not guess. Ask based on the principles outlined here.

10. A Final Guiding Principle

FairWorkly is a system that produces decisions people must trust.

Every architectural constraint exists to protect that trust.
